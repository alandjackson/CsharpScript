* Synopsis

  To Demonstrate a scripting interface in windows .net using Mono.

* Overview

  On startup, a command window shows that will execute c# code.

  Try entering "3+1;"

* Application Control

  There is a dialog with a single text box and a single button.

  To show the dialog:
  
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  App.Setup.Show();
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  To set the text box:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  App.Setup.Name = "MyName";
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  To hit the button

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  App.Setup.SayHello();
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Design

  The scripting classes are static managers of the program and windows form.

  They can be found under Scripting/App.cs and Managers/SetupManager.cs


* Future Work

  Compiling the Mono Compiler Services from source was giving me a ton
  of trouble, so I just downloaded the demo from Miguel de Icaza's blog
